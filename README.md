4d6 Drop the Lowest - Bingo Edition
A quick way to roll dice for a new character!
The JS that runs on page load simulates rolling 4d6 and dropping the lowest value and summing the rest, then repeats that operation 36 times and arrays them in a 6x6 layout. Then it sums the rows, columns and diagonals, while also highlighting any maximum rolls (18's) that appeared. 

Mad Props to Jocelyn Gonzalez, who pushed me to actually make this, and who coded the majority of the logic for the actual rolling.
